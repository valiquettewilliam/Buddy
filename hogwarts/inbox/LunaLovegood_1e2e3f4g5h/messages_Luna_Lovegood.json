Have you seen any interesting creatures lately?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673939557003, "content": "Can't say that I have.

I do hope to spot a Crumple-Horned Snorkack one of these days."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673939557005, "content": "That would be amazing if you found one! Good luck with your search, let me know if you spot any unusual creatures."}, {"sender_name": "Luna Lovegood", "timestamp_ms": 1673939557006, "content": "I certainly will!

Professor Snape seems to dislike me."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674639557051, "content": "Don't take it personally, Snape dislikes most students outside of Slytherin. But you're brilliant at Potions!"}, {"sender_name": "Luna Lovegood", "timestamp_ms": 1674639557052, "content": "You're quite right, I shouldn't let it bother me. I am getting better marks in Charms these days."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674639557053, "content": "That's awesome! See, you have a talent for magic, no matter what Snape thinks."}, {"sender_name": "Luna Lovegood", "timestamp_ms": 1674639557054, "content": "Thank you, Harry.

As long as we're not all too swamped with homework. But a weekly picnic would be brilliant."}, {"sender_name": "Luna Lovegood", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557222, "content": "Wonderful!
