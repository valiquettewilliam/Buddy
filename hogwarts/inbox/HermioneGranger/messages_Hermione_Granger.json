How's your summer going so far?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500100, "content": "Harry! Lovely to hear from you. My summer is going well, though I do miss everyone. I'm spending most of my time going through my books and researching fascinating new topics. How about you?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500200, "content": "I miss you all too. The Dursleys are being their usual unpleasant selves but I'm getting by. At least I can practice some spells in my room without them knowing. Let me know if you find anything good in your researching!"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500300, "content": "Ugh, sorry to hear the Dursleys are still dreadful. Remember you can always come stay with us if it gets to be too much. I'm looking into advanced defensive magic at the moment - it's so interesting! I'll be sure to share anything useful I uncover."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500400, "content": "Thanks, Hermione, I appreciate that. Advanced defensive magic sounds brilliant, I'd love to learn more about that whenever we're back at Hogwarts. The more skills we can gain the better."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500500, "content": "I completely agree! One can never be too prepared, especially with the threats we seem to face every year at school. I'll put together a study plan for us when term starts again. We'll be experts in no time!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500600, "content": "That sounds perfect. Your study plans are always top-notch! Speaking of school, have you gotten your book list for next term yet? I'm interested to see what's coming up."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500700, "content": "I did get my book list last week! Lots of interesting titles, including 'Defensive Magical Theory' by Wilbert Slinkhard for Defense Against the Dark Arts. I've already started reading through some of them."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500800, "content": "Of course you have! I'm excited to check out the new Defense book, hopefully this professor will actually teach us useful material. Do you know anything about who's taking over for Moody?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1673955500900, "content": "No idea yet, Dumbledore is keeping it very hush-hush as usual. But I agree, it would be nice to have a proper curriculum again. Either way, we'll make sure to keep up our skills."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673955501000, "content": "Good point, we'll just have to see when we get there. One mystery at a time! Anyway, enough about school - are you going anywhere fun this summer?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1673955501100, "content": "My parents and I are planning a trip to France in a few weeks! I can't wait to experience wizarding Paris. What about you, any exciting plans coming up?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1673955501200, "content": "That sounds amazing! I've always wanted to see France. The Dursleys would never take me anywhere that exciting of course. But maybe I can visit the Weasleys at some point."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1673955501300, "content": "I certainly hope you'll be able to visit the Weasleys or come stay with me before term starts. The Dursleys have no right to keep you cooped up all summer! At least we can write often."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674155501400, "content": "For sure, writingletters helps pass the time. Let me know how your trip to France goes! I want to hear all about it."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674155501500, "content": "I definitely will! I plan on taking loads of notes and pictures to share with you and Ron. Have you heard from him at all this summer?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674155501600, "content": "Just a quick note saying hello. You know Ron, he gets distracted over the holidays. I'm sure we'll get an earful on the Hogwarts Express!"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674155501700, "content": "Too right! I can only imagine the tales he'll have about the joke shop and Quidditch adventures. It'll be nice for us all to be together again soon."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674155501800, "content": "Definitely! Only a few more weeks to go. Feels like it's been ages already. Are you getting excited to be a prefect?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674155501900, "content": "Oh yes, I can hardly wait! I've been reading up on protocols and responsibilities. I do hope I can live up to expectations and set a good example."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674155502000, "content": "I'm sure you'll be brilliant at it! Hogwarts couldn't ask for a better prefect. Let me know if you need any help with your duties."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674155502100, "content": "Thank you, Harry, I really appreciate your faith in me. I'll certainly take you up on your offer if I need any assistance. Perhaps we can strategize patrol schedules!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674155502200, "content": "I'd be happy to help with schedules or anything else. We make a pretty good team after all. And just think of all the sneaking around we can avoid this year!"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674155502300, "content": "Very true, it will make life easier not having to sneak about after hours. Not that we were ever up to trouble, of course! I am looking forward to the access to the prefects' bathroom though."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674155502400, "content": "Naturally, we were always on important business! The fancy bathroom does sound brilliant. Don't forget us common folk when you're relaxing in there!"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674355502500, "content": "I would never! The three of us have far too many adventures planned. Speaking of which, I've uncovered some intriguing locked doors in my Hogwarts map studies..."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674355502600, "content": "Now you're speaking my language! Locked doors are just begging to be investigated. We'll have to scout around once we're back and see what we can uncover."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674355502700, "content": "My thoughts exactly! A nice mystery to solve together. I'll mark the ones I've identified so far on my map. Who knows what secrets we might find!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674355502800, "content": "This is so exciting! Hogwarts won't know what hit it when you, me and Ron are on the case. We do make an unbeatable team."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674355502900, "content": "We really do balance each other out nicely in our adventures! Your courage, Ron's strategy, and my research - I daresay we could unravel any Hogwarts enigma."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674355503000, "content": "Too right! With our combined skills, no mystery stands a chance. This year's looking very promising already and we haven't even made it back yet."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674355503100, "content": "I quite agree! September 1st can't come soon enough. We'll have to make up for lost adventuring over the summer. At least I'll have tales from France to share on the way to school."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674355503200, "content": "That's true, and I can't wait to hear all about your trip! Only a couple more weeks until we're back aboard the Hogwarts Express swapping stories."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674555050400, "content": "Oh Harry, France was absolutely magical! The wizarding areas of Paris are just breathtaking. I found the most fascinating historical texts too."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674555050500, "content": "That's amazing, Hermione! I knew you'd find it brilliant. What were some of your favorite parts? Any recommendations for if I ever get to visit?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674555050600, "content": "The Palace of Versailles was stunning - the halls just radiate centuries of magical history. And wizarding Notre Dame is spectacular. We must go together someday!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674555050700, "content": "That sounds incredible! I'd love to experience it with you and Ron. Hogwarts will feel so boring and normal after all that splendor!"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674555050800, "content": "As much as I do cherish Hogwarts, it was quite fun experiencing a new magical place. But the three of us will liven things up there I'm sure!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674555050900, "content": "Too right we will! New year, new secrets and mysteries to uncover. Speaking of, have you spotted any promising locked doors on your map?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674555051000, "content": "I've marked a few intriguing ones! There's one on the fifth floor behind that statue of Boris the Bewildered that seems promising."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674555051100, "content": "Excellent find! That statue always did seem a bit out of place. We'll have to be sure and investigate once term starts."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674555051200, "content": "It's a date! I do hope it leads somewhere exciting. I've also noted a peculiar one-eyed witch passage that might warrant snooping."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1674555051300, "content": "You're brilliant, Hermione! With clues like these, we'll have the secrets of Hogwarts laid bare in no time."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 1674555051400, "content": "Why thank you! With your cloak and our wits, unraveling Hogwarts mysteries should be a piece of cake this year."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16747555051500, "content": "Too right! I can't wait to finally be back. The train leaves tomorrow - meet you at King's Cross?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16747555051600, "content": "Absolutely! I'll be there bright and early. Shall we try to grab our favorite carriage? I can't wait to catch up in person."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16747555051700, "content": "Sounds perfect. I'll be on the lookout and grab us seats. See you tomorrow! It's been far too long."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16747555051800, "content": "See you tomorrow, Harry! I can hardly believe it's finally time. This will be a wonderful year, I just know it."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560000, "content": "Hermione! So great to see you on the train yesterday. Back at Hogwarts at last!"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560100, "content": "Harry, it was wonderful journeying to school together again! I'm so happy we're back in classes."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560200, "content": "Me too, it feels like home being back here. And Umbridge seems...interesting. I'm reserving judgment for now."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560300, "content": "Yes, she's certainly a character! No practical defensive magic is concerning though. We may need to take matters into our own hands..."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560400, "content": "I was thinking the same thing. Extra defense lessons might be in order if she's not going to teach us properly."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560500, "content": "Precisely! Perhaps you could head up lessons - you have loads of real experience. I'm sure many students would join."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560600, "content": "Blimey, me teach everyone? I never thought about that but I guess I could give it a go. Where do you think we should meet up for these lessons?"}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560700, "content": "The Room of Requirement would be perfect! It can provide whatever we need. This feels important, Harry. I really think you could make a difference."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560800, "content": "When you put it like that it does seem worthwhile. Alright, let's draw up some plans! The DA is officially happening."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16748395560900, "content": "Wonderful! This is so exciting. Your leadership and guidance will be invaluable. We'd best keep it all hush-hush of course."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16748395561000, "content": "Naturally, mum's the word. Wouldn't want Umbridge catching wind of any rebellious defensive magic lessons! This will be brilliant though."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16750395561200, "content": "The first DA meeting was an astounding success! You're a natural teacher, Harry."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16750395561300, "content": "All thanks to your planning! I couldn't have done it without you. Feels good to be preparing and taking action."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16750395561400, "content": "It really does make a difference taking our defense education into our own hands. Everyone clearly looks up to you already."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16750395561500, "content": "They make me sound more impressive than I am, but I'm happy to teach them useful skills if it helps. Your protective enchantments on the list were genius too."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16750395561600, "content": "We make quite a team! I do hope these lessons can make a difference if things at Hogwarts get worse. Knowledge is power."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 16750395561700, "content": "Too right. The more prepared we are the better, especially with someone like Umbridge around. This feels big though. Like we're part of something important."}, {"sender_name": "Hermione Granger", "timestamp_ms": 16750395561800, "content": "I couldn't agree more. Training ourselves and others feels significant. We could inspire real change here."}], "title": "Hermione Granger", "is_still_participant": true, "thread_path": "inbox/HermioneGranger", "magic_words": []}
