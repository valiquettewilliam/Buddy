Classes keeping you busy?"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556282, "content": "Hey Harry! Classes are going alright, though Potions is still a nightmare. How are things with you?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556283, "content": "Not too bad! Auror training is fascinating but exhausting. I'm learning loads though. Are you planning anything fun for the holidays coming up?"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556284, "content": "That's great to hear! The holidays should be nice, mum is planning a big family meal as usual. Will you and Ginny be able to make it?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556285, "content": "I wouldn't miss it! Let me check with Ginny about her Quidditch schedule and make sure she's free. When are you all thinking of getting together?"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556286, "content": "I think Mum said Christmas Eve dinner, like usual. Let me know what Ginny's schedule is looking like whenever you find out!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556287, "content": "Sounds good, I'll let you know as soon as I hear from Ginny. I know she's hoping to make it but the team schedule around the holidays gets tricky. How are your classes going? Still struggling with Potions?"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556288, "content": "Ugh, Potions is the worst. I don't know how anyone is supposed to memorize all these recipes and reactions. And Snape breathing down my neck definitely doesn't help. Charms and Transfiguration are going alright though. How about you, how's Auror training?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556289, "content": "Auror training is intense but really interesting. We're learning all kinds of defensive spells and how to track down dark wizards. The program is no joke though, I'm definitely being challenged. But it'll be worth it to become a fully qualified Auror in the end."}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556290, "content": "That sounds brilliant! You'll be the youngest Auror in no time. By the way, I meant to ask if you caught the last Chudley Cannons match? I couldn't believe they actually managed to pull off a win!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556291, "content": "Haha I did see that! Couldn't believe it either, maybe they're finally turning things around this season. I hope so, you deserve to see them succeed after all these years of sticking by them."}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556292, "content": "It would be a dream come true! Fingers crossed they can keep this streak going. How are things with you and Ginny? You two seem really happy together."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556293, "content": "We really are, thanks! It's so nice being able to be together without Voldemort looming over everything. She's incredible, I feel so lucky. How about you, any romance on the horizon?"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556294, "content": "That's really great to hear, mate. As for me, not much to report on the romance front lately. I did go to Hogsmeade with Susan Bones recently though, that was fun."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556295, "content": "Ooh excellent, Susan's really nice! I hope you two hit it off. You'll have to give me all the details next time I see you!"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556296, "content": "For sure! She is really great. Nothing serious yet but we're planning to go to Hogsmeade again soon. I'll let you know how it goes. Anyway, I should get to bed but it was great chatting! Talk soon?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675537556297, "content": "Definitely, get some rest! Looking forward to hearing all about the next Hogsmeade date. Sweet dreams!"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675639556298, "content": "Hey Harry! Sorry I haven't written in a few days, things have been busy here. How are you doing?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675639556299, "content": "No worries at all Ron! I'm doing well, thanks. Busy with Auror training as usual. What's new at Hogwarts?"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675639556300, "content": "Glad to hear you're doing well! Hogwarts is good, just the usual classes and homework.

I want to hear all about it."}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675639556302, "content": "It was really nice! We went to Madame Puddifoot's for tea and just talked for ages. I think we're going to keep seeing each other when we can. I really like spending time with her."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675639556303, "content": "That's amazing, Ron, I'm so happy for you! Susan seems like a great match. It's so nice you've found someone you really connect with."}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675639556304, "content": "Thanks, mate! I'm pretty thrilled about it. It's still early days but it just feels easy with her, you know? Anyway, enough about me - how are things with Ginny and the Harpies?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675639556305, "content": "Things with Ginny are wonderful, she's doing so well with the Harpies! They've got a big match coming up against the Tornados..."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557197, "content": "Amazing! Well you definitely have my vote for Brother of the Year. I know how much this trip meant to Ginny."}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557198, "content": "Thanks, Harry! Though after years of you looking out for me, I think you've got Brother of the Year on lock."}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557199, "content": "Ha, I appreciate that Ron. You're definitely giving me a run for my money though! Anyway, I should probably try to get some sleep. Can't wait to see you at the Burrow in a few days!"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557200, "content": "Sounds good, get some rest! So excited for the holidays. Talk to you soon!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557201, "content": "Hey Ron, happy holidays! Hope you're having a great time at the Burrow."}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557202, "content": "Happy holidays, Harry! The Burrow is chaotic as always, but in the best way. How's your Christmas going?"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1675939557203, "content": "Really great, thanks!

This one's going to be all Quidditch matches and cozy pubs!"}, {"sender_name": "Ron Weasley", "timestamp_ms": 1676039557216, "content": "Now that's what I like to hear! Speaking of Quidditch, I can't wait for the league to start up again.
