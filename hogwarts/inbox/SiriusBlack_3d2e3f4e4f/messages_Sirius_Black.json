Glad to hear Quidditch is going well though. Gryffindor better win the Cup this year!"}, {"sender_name": "Harry Potter", "timestamp_ms": 1671395600005, "content": "We're certainly going to try!

I'm already focusing on our next game against Ravenclaw. Their Seeker Cho Chang is really talented."}, {"sender_name": "Sirius Black", "timestamp_ms": 1671695600017, "content": "Ah yes, Cho's a strong player. But you have the faster broom and more experience.
